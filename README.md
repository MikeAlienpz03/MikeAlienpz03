## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ˜„
I am currently learning Python to develop myself in the DataScience and Machine Learning industry. 

ğŸ˜„
I like object oriented programming in Python.
I like the idea of being able to collaborate with people who have created projects that apply to data mining, automation and applications in the financial world.
